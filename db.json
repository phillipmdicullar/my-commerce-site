                "description": "The most advanced Mac laptops for demanding workflows.\r\nThree giant leaps: MacBook Pro blasts forward with the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. Built on 3-nanometer technology and featuring an all-new GPU architecture, they’re the most advanced chips ever built for a personal computer. And each one brings more pro performance and capability.\r\nGame-changing graphics performance:\r\n- Behold an entirely new class of GPU architecture. And the biggest breakthrough in graphics yet for Apple silicon. Dynamic Caching optimizes fast on-chip memory to dramatically increase average GPU utilization — driving a huge performance boost for the most demanding pro apps and games.\r\n- Games will look more detailed than ever thanks to hardware-accelerated mesh shading. This brings greater capability and efficiency to geometry processing, enabling games to render more visually complex scenes.\r\nHardware-accelerated ray tracing: For the first time, MacBook Pro features hardware-accelerated ray tracing. Combined with the new graphics architecture, it enables pro apps to deliver up to two and a half times faster rendering performance and allows games to provide more realistic shadows and reflections.\r\nWe can do this all day: MacBook Pro has the longest battery life ever in a Mac — up to 22 hours. That efficiency is the magic of Apple silicon. And all models remain just as fast whether plugged in or not. So wherever inspiration strikes or whenever duty calls, run with it.\r\nThe best display ever in a laptop: Extreme Dynamic Range (XDR) brings refined specular highlights, incredible detail in shadows, and vibrant, true-to-life colors. Calibrated in the factory, each Liquid Retina XDR display also features ProMotion and pro reference modes.\r\nAmps up apps: With thousands of apps optimized to unlock the full power of macOS and Apple silicon, M3 chips accelerate performance like never before. Now apps just soar — from your go-to productivity apps to your favorite games and hardest-working pro apps.",
